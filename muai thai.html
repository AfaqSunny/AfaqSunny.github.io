    <h1>Muai Thai</h1>
    <p>Muay Thai is a combat sport that finds its origin in a noble art with antique traditions, it is also the Thai national sport. I n Muay Thai, competitors fight standing like in Western Boxing, but elbows, knees and kicks strikes are allowed, with the only protection being the gloves; an important part of this fighting style is the clinch (standing wrestle). 
        MUAY literally means “combat” and it derives from the Sanskrit (original Hindu language) word “Mavya” which literally means “unite together”. While the word THAI is an adjective of the thai nation, its meaning is “free people”. Therefore, the word Muay Thai is translatable as “Thai boxing/combat”. 
        In english the world Muay Thai is generically translated as Thai Boxe. Sadly, this word “Thai Boxe” has created confusion since the Dutch and european in general after them, started to call Thai Boxe their way of fighting Kick Boxing in a Muay Thai oriented way, but which still remains Kick Boxing and cannot be considered Muay Thai, because it can only be when the rules and scoring system are exactly the same as the ones used in the stadiums in Bangkok, mostly Lumpinee. 
        In Western countries, with the definition Muay Thai Full Rules it is intended the official rules used in the big stadiums in Thailand, because, when Western promoters talk about Muay Thai it’s always a question mark on whether it is “real” Muay Thai or Kickboxing “dressed” as Muay Thai. The various fighting styles like: K1, Glory, Fight Code rules or Muay Thai without elbow or limited clinching and others are nothing more than a way to sell Kick Boxing to the audience as it was Muay Thai. 
        Non expert audience often falls in this trap, therefore, we suggest to who wants to see “real” Muay Thai to go to Thailand and, especially, once in a lifetime attend and event at the Mecca of Muay Thai: Lumpinee Stadium. We want to specify that only the greatest Nak Muays (professional Muay Thai fighters) of all times have fought at Lumpinee Stadium and that a one is not Nak Muay unless he hasn’t, at least once, fought and won at Bangkok’s Lumpinee Stadium. 
        The stadium had an historic location, where the greatest Thai and a few Farangs (non Thai) fighters have competed, unfortunately, this will remain the history because this location has been destroyed and replaced by a new modern one. Only who fought at Lumpinee until February 8th 2014 can tell about the epic battles of the “old” Lumpinee Stadium in Rama IV Road near the Lumpini Park and can be proud to have stepped on the same ring as the legends of “real” Muay Thai like: Dieselnoi Chor Thanasukar, Samart Payakaroon, Somrak Kamsing, Saenchai Sor Kingstar, Ramon Dekkers, Kaosai Galaxi ecc.</p>

    <h2>Training</h2>
    <p> Real Muay Thai training is sure to be found in Thailand, and the choice of the “camp” is very important. A gym where one lives, eats and trains “real” Muay Thai. For thai fighters, the choice is made based on the area they live as kids and then it evolves into a market just like it is for soccer in western countries (Link). 
        . There are camps in rural areas specialized on bringing up very young Thai Nak Muays to than sell them to big camps in Bangkok to grant them a future in the big stadiums and overseas. Historic camps of Bangkok and of many touristic location in Thailand, at first, did not accept “Farang” (western or non thai) fighters. To fully understand this situation it’s interesting to watch the movie “Chock Dee”. The story told in the movie represents the reality until the Nineties, but then the Thais understood that foreigners were ready to pay well to train in Thai camps and that they would accept to stay in uncomfortable locations; thats how the business of tourists from all over the world coming to try the experience of Muay Thai in Thailand, was born. In the latest years, new traditional camps, are born, with the feature of clean, modern and comfortable structures, so that who would like to try the Muay Thai experience but also wants to stay in a decent room and area and without risking to get some infections, fungus or simply to sleep well at night. Some of this structures are on the beach as well, for example, this new camp in the heart of real Thailand, where Thai culture, crystal clear sea and Muay Thai merge toghter: www.7MuayThai.com
